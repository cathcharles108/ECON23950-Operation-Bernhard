# ECON23950-Operation-Bernhard
A paper submitted for the University of Chicago's ECON 23950 (Economic Policy Analysis) class that analyzes Operation Bernhard through the lens of the Kiyotaki-Wright Model in macroeconomics. Operation Bernhard was a tactic used in WWII by Nazi Germany against Britain. Nazi Germany counterfeited British money in order to destabilize the British economy. I analyze this incident and make a determination on whether this was a good wartime strategy.

# What is the Kiyotaki-Wright Model?
A macroeconomic model that utilizes money as a form of an exchange in a society of goods holders and money holders. The original model was proposed in the 1989 paper 'On Money as a Medium of Exchange,' by Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and Randall Wright. The paper can be found here: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1832197.

# Summary (snippet from the Introduction)
"This paper will model and analyze this [counterfeiting] strategy by looking specifically at Operation Bernhard, though the results can be applied to other counterfeiting incidents during war as well. The analysis will be structured as follows. First, the report begins by analyzing data from the monetary authorities of Britain and Australia about counterfeit money and its effects. Subsequently, the report proposes a variant of the money-search model that illustrates the impact of this scenario on a model economy and conducts a simulation of the model. Finally, the report concludes that this strategy is ineffective given that the local economy can manipulate its money supply and issue a new currency to evade such tactics."

# Model Simulation
The coding portion of this paper is a simulation of the proposed model in reference to Operation Bernhard. All code is done on Python.

# Conclusion
The paper concludes that to achieve maximum devastation while costing the least to themselves, Nazi Germany should have produced a certain amount of counterfeit, but with terrible quality so as they can be discovered immediately after each transaction. This finding is certainly counterproductive, and I conclude, therefore, that Operation Bernhard (and other similar wartime operations) are not good wartime strategies.
